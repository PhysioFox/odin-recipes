        <h2>Sushi</h2>
        <p>Do you love rice? Do you love seaweed? Do you love other things that you can put in your rice and seaweed? If that's the case, then read on. This is going to cover the basics of the rice and the rolling process, the actual ingredients to go into the middle of the roll is totally up to you. We won't cover the prep of that part :)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="center">
            <ul>
                <li>Sushi rice</li>
                <li>Mirin</li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>Sushi nori</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Sushi rolling mat, covered in cling film</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="center2">
            <ol>
                <li>Measure our your sushi rice and water. You want to use 1:1.2 ratio of rice:water</li>
                <li>Rinse your sushi rice off well under running water until it runs clear.</li>
                <li>Put the sushi rice and water together into a pot over high heat. Once it starts to boil, turn it to a low simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Once this timer goes off, take it off heat and leave for 10 more minutes. Once it's done, add salt and mirin to taste and then set aside to cool. </li>
                <li>It's important that the rice is cooled prior to the next step.</li>
                <li>Lay our your nori on top of your rolling mat, and then add a handful of sushi rice to it. It's helpful to have a bowl of water around for this, to keep your hands wet as this stops everything from sticking. It's best to add enough rice that you cover up mostly to the edge.</li>
                <li>Place your filling of choice into the middle of the roll, and then roll up your sushi roll. It's hard to get this tight, don't worry if your first few go awry!</li>
                <li>Once all of your rolls are done, moisten your knife with a wet towel and commence to chopping into little chunks. Dip in soy sauce, add some wasabi if that's your bag, or even some pickled ginger...and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
